## Research to use

## About

This app can be connected to the other devices using bluetooth low technology.<br>
Bluetooth LE can connect without authorization, so peripheral devices without knowing when established connection. It is easy and suitable for experiment.

<br>

## Compute variables

This page has computing VI or VR values. The researchers are compute using this app, and the value use your programs.

<br>

- Select algorithm
	- You can select VI algorithms.
- Value
	- The field is integer, if you set 2 seconds, enter 2000 (ms)
- Number of SR
	- Number of compute values. if this value is too much, cause of freeze.
