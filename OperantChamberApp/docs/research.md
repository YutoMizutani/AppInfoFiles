## Research

<br>

## Data analysis

### Cumulative record

In result view, See cumulative record by horizontal swipe.

### Data saving

In result view, multiple save functions the app has.

- Save data
	- The data saved into your app. The data can see Top/Results/Saved results.
- Export raw data
	- The raw data text saves to local storage. The texts can picked up using computers. See also [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301).
- Upload to Dropbox
	- The raw data text uploads to Dropbox. You can access the data from Dropbox.

## Compute variables

This page has computing VI or VR values. The researchers are compute using this app, and the value use your programs.

<br>

- Select algorithm
	- You can select VI algorithms.
- Value
	- The field is integer, if you set 2 seconds, enter 2000 (ms)
- Number of SR
	- Number of compute values. if this value is too much, cause of freeze.

## Connect to external devices

This app can be connected to the other devices using bluetooth low technology.<br>
Bluetooth LE can connect without authorization, so peripheral devices without knowing when established connection. It is easy and suitable for experiment. For iPad to iPhone, iPhone to iPhone, iPhone to Arduino® with extend chambers or feeders.

<br>

Previous research, An experiment needs An operant chamber, a computer, and an I/O board.

Using this app, it can create and compute contingencies. So it is substituted for your computer.

And then, A rat if you use, responses are catched from a touch screen (Pineño, 2014). So you can do the experiment with only a feeder!

Experiment on humans, only iOS device, iOS to iOS communication is like social experiment!

How to use it? I'm looking for your ideas!

If you contact me, see Copyright page on the app.

Thank you.
